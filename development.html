    <h1>We used several tools and platforms to build and manage this project efficiently: <br>
      Trello helped us plan each week’s tasks, delegate responsibilities, and keep deadlines visible. <br>
      YouTube Studio allowed us to analyze audience behavior, adjust content type, and optimize publishing times. <br>
      Editing software like CapCut and Adobe Premiere Pro allowed us to craft a clear, engaging visual style. <br>
      Analytics Insights: <br>
      Our largest audience comes from smartphones — so we began prioritizing vertical-friendly and mobile-optimized content. <br>
      We noticed more engagement from female viewers, so we're working to diversify our content to attract male viewers too. <br>
      USA and European viewers made up the majority, guiding how we format titles, language, and timing. <br>
